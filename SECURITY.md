Bug Reports

What time will it take for HSI to respond?
It is unknown what time it will take,

WHY WAS MY SECURITY FLAW DENIED
It can be from the following reasons:
The Flaw invaild or there is no proof of the error,
the flaw is easily by turning FilteringEnabled to true
the flaw is going to be fixed in an upcoming update.
getting the Cross posting tag means it was denied, most likely the flaw has already been pointed out.
